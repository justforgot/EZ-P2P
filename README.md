# EZ-P2P
EZ P2P is the best way to direct file transfer for free, just open the file using a chromium based browser and connect! There is a chat feature, and you can connect up to four devices at once.

To connect, first download the file called "EZ-P2P" on GitHub, then change the name to "EZP2P.html" then open it in a Chromium-based browser.
Click "Create Offer" in peer slot one, then send that string of numbers and letters to the device that you would like to connect to.
Then on the second device, paste the string in "Peer SDP" on peer slot 1 and click "Create Answer".
Send the new string of numbers that popped up in "Your SDP" to the first device.
Put that string of numbers in "Peer SDP" on the first device and hit "Add Answer" After that, you should be all set!

Extra Notes:
When you send a file to a peer and that peer hits download, they get the raw file. (no compression/processing)
If the two devices do not connect, make sure you are on either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. (Other browsers may work; however, Opera GX is known to not work with this build) 


PLEASE
Do not connect to people you do not trust. Whatever you do with this program, please be careful who you connect to. (Connecting to a random Discord user probably isnt a good idea.)
